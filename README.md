# Canvas-Style-LMS
A school project based on a basic learning management system (LMS) inspired by Canvas, featuring student and instructor views, course and assignment management, and user enrollment.

## Project Context

This application was developed as part of my coursework in full-app development at Florida State University. It demonstrates core concepts in:
- Front-end and back-end integration
- User interface design
- Local data handling
- Independent problem solving and UI architecture

Regular feedback and guidance were obtained from my instructor during development office hours.
